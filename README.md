# Process_Optimization_OvGU_2023-24
Project Task of Process Optimization course during my Masters in OvGU

>    This project involves the application of various optimization methods to determine the optimal operating parameters for a methanation reactor. The goal is to maximize the methane output. The results of these optimization methods will be analyzed and represented graphically to provide a clear understanding of the reactorâ€™s optimal operating conditions.
